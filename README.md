# Building Smart LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Robots
This is the code repository for [Building Smart LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Robots](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/building-smart-lego-mindstorms-ev3-robots?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788471565), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Smart robots are an ever-increasing part of our daily lives. With the LEGO MINDSTORMSEV3, you can now prototype your very own small-scale smart robot that uses specialized programming and hardware to complete a mission. The EV3 is a robotics platform for enthusiasts of all ages and experience levels that makes prototyping robots accessible to all.

This book will walk you through six different projects that range from intermediate to advanced level. The projects will show you building and programming techniques that are used by engineers in the real world, which will help you build your own smart robot.

You’ll see how to make the most of the EV3 robotics platform and build some awesome smart robots. The book starts by introducing some real-world examples of smart robots. Then, we’ll walk you through six different projects and explain the features that allow these robots to make intelligent decisions. The book will guide you as you build your own object-tracking tank, a box climbing robot, an interactive robotic shark, a quirky bipedal robot, a speedy remote control race car, and a GPS-navigating robot.

By the end of this book, you’ll have the skills necessary to build and program your own smart robots with the EV3.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:

Spend some time familiarizing yourself with EV3. It is graphical programming software in which programs are written by connecting code blocks together. You should know the names of the blocks and where to find each one of them in the programming palette. You should also be comfortable with dragging and dropping blocks to place them in your program, know how to change their modes, and have a basic understanding of what individual blocks do.
